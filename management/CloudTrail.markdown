# CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs.

AWS KMS is integrated with CloudTrail, a service that captures API calls made by or on behalf of AWS KMS in your AWS account and delivers log files to an S3 bucket that you specify.
