# Route53 main functions
- Domain registration
- Domain name system (DNS) service
    - Translate friendly domain names into IP address.
    - Can route internet traffic to CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, ELB, or S3.
- Heath checking



# Supported DNS Resource Record Types:
## A (Address) Format: 
A record is an IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation, e.g. 192.168.1.12
(base) âžœ  AWS_Certification dig A www.google.com

```bash
$ dig A google.com

[...]

;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com.        62    IN    A    216.58.201.14

[...]
```


## AAAA format: IPv6 address

```bash
$ dig AAAA www.google.com

[...]

;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.google.com.		83	IN	AAAA	2a00:1450:400f:80c::2004

[...]
```

## CNAME format:
CNAME (Canonical Name) can be  used to alias one name to another. A common example is when you have both dnsimple.com and www.dnsimple.com pointing to the same application and hosted by the same server.

```bash
$ dig A www.dnsimple.com 

[...]

;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.dnsimple.com.	2759	IN	CNAME	dnsimple.com.
dnsimple.com.		60	IN	A	104.245.210.170

[...]
```

##  ALIAS record:

ALIAS is similar to a CNAME records, but can create an alias record both for the root domain or apex zone, such as example.com, and for subdomains, such as www.example.com. CNAME records can only be used for subdomains.

In AWS you have to use ALIAS records to point your root domain to other DNS records such as your ELB.

## MX (Mail Xchange) format: 
 MX contains a decimanl number that represents the priority of the MX record, and the domain name of an email server.

## NS (name server) format
NS (Name server) indicates which DNS server is authoritative for that domain.

```bash
$ dig NS google.com    

[...]

;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com.		11252	IN	NS	ns2.google.com.
google.com.		11252	IN	NS	ns4.google.com.
google.com.		11252	IN	NS	ns1.google.com.
google.com.		11252	IN	NS	ns3.google.com.

[...]
```

## SOA Record
A SOA (Start of Authority) record is a type of resource record in the DNS containing adminstrative information about the zone.

```bash
$ dig SOA +multiline google.com   

[...]

;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com.		53 IN SOA ns1.google.com. dns-admin.google.com. (
				309542872  ; serial
				900        ; refresh (15 minutes)
				900        ; retry (15 minutes)
				1800       ; expire (30 minutes)
				60         ; minimum (1 minute)
				)
