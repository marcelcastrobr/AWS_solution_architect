# Code Deploy

AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates  software deployments to a variety of compute services such as Amazon  EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and your on-premises servers. AWS  CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features,  helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the  complexity of updating your applications.



Key facts:

- AWS CodeDeploy **rolls back deployments** by redeploying a previously  deployed revision of an application as a new deployment on the failed  instances.
