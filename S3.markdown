# S3 - Simple Storage Service Definition

# S3 Facts
- Object storage: flat files
- Objects consists of:
    - Key (name of object)
    - Value (this is simply the data)
    - Version ID (versioning)
    - Metadata
    - Subresources like access control lists and torrent
- Size: 0 to 5 TBytes
- S3 uses a universal namespace (i.e. unique name)
- Uloaded code get 200 HTTP response.

# S3 Features
- Tiered storage available
- Lifecycle Management
- Versioning
- Encription
- MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Secure date using Access Control lists and Bucket Policies.

# S3 Storage Gateway 

## S3 Storage Gateway Types:
1. File gateway (NFS & SMB): 
    - flat files stored directly on S3
    - store and retrieve files directly using the NFS version 3 or 4.1 protocol.
    - store and retrieve files directly using the SMB file system version, 2 and 3 protocol.
    - access the data directly in S3 from any AWS Cloud application or service.
    - manage S3 data using lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and versioning.

2. Volume gateway (iSCSI)
    - Stored Volumes: 
        - data stored on site and assynchronous backed up to S3.
        - Gateway-stored volume configuration provides durable and inexpensive off-site backups that you can recover to your local data center or Amazon EC2. For example, if you need replacement capacity for disaster recovery, you can recover the backups to Amazon EC2
        - 
    - Cached Volumes: 
        - data is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached on site.
        - All gateway-cached volume data and snapshot data is stored in Amazon S3 encrypted at rest using server-side encryption (SSE) and it cannot be accessed with S3 API or any other tools
3. Tape Gateway
    - 

## Storage Gateway Facts
- AWS Storage Gateway backs up the data in Amazon Storage as incremental EBS snapshots
- AWS Storage Gateway, by default, uploads data using SSL and provides data encryption at rest when stored in S3 or Glacier using AES-256
